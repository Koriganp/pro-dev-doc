				<p><strong>Version 1</strong></p>
				<p>Hi! My name is Korigan. I have this new website that allows you to share with and meet new people. Instead of
				being stuck behind a screen, it combines the aspects of social media, that people love, with the real world! Have
				you met new people that have the same interests as you recently?</p>

				<p><strong>Version 2</strong></p>
				<p>Hi! My name is Korigan. I recently began learning to code and am excited about the things I'm learning and
				how they can benefit people. I can make dynamic websites and have a wide skill-set. What is online presence like?
				Are you happy with the results, or do you think they could be better?</p>

			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<br/>
			<p>This week was mostly review on the prework. However, there were a few components that were new to me, such as
			the flow diagram. It was similar to the raptor program that Brian Jones demonstrated at the Tuesday evening TedTalk. I
			am excited about the things to come and am eager to learn by jumping in and learning from the mistakes that I am
			inevitably going to make.</p>

			<h3>Week 2</h3>
