				<h3 class="center">Elevator Pitch</h3>
				<p><strong>Version 1</strong></p>
				<p>Hi! My name is Korigan. I specialize in web security. There are so many new threats and attacks online today that the thought of preparing for them and keeping up can be daunting. I've been able to help some companies prevent some attacks and leaks. Are you prepared for an online attack?</p>
				<p><strong>Version 2</strong></p>
				<p>Hi! My name is Korigan. I recently began learning to code and am excited about the things I'm learning and how they can benefit people. I can make dynamic websites and have a wide skill-set. What is online presence like? Are you happy with the results, or do you think they could be better?</p>

				<h2 class="center">Weekly Reflections</h2>
				<h3>Week 1</h3>
				<p>This week was mostly review on the prework. However, there were a few components that were new to me, such a the flow diagram. It was similar to the raptor program that Brian Jones demonstrated at the Tuesday evening TedTalk. Iam excited about the things to come and am eager to learn by jumping in and learning from the mistakes that I am inevitably going to make.</p>
				<h3>Week 2</h3>
				<p>This week was learning the basics of PHP and MySQL interaction. I found the material to be easy to comprehend as well as simple to perform. I became frustrated with the errors that came up in the PHPStorm software, so I worked ahead to connect the missing pieces required for the errors to be removed. I also was able to start working on the next steps due to being ahead. I also met with Daniel and Karen and discussed my progress in the class as well as what I planned for myself after completion.</p>
				<h3>Week 3</h3>
				<p>This week started with a review of object-oriented and MySQL. We learned about the PDO Classes and making PDO statements. Around midweek we began discussing capstone ideas and by Friday had voted on them and had the group we will be working with. My group consists of Jack Arnold, Neena Purnell, and Kevin Atkins (and of course, myself). We began throwing around ideas of what we wanted our site to look like, its function, what would be required, and then created our personas and our conceptual model. I am excited to get this show going!!</p>
				<h3>Week 4</h3>
				<p>This week was a lot more time coding on our capstone projects. We completed the CSS Challenge and had a discussion in class on it, as well as Bootstrap 4. We also got a demonstration of the phpunit testing as well as the dependencies we needed to install in order for the unit testing to work. I completed one of the classes for our capstone as well as worked on the test. I still have 3 errors and 1 failure to resolve, but a lot less than when I started the test.On the 1st, we went to 1 Million Cups networking event and I met a couple of people who I am probably going to talk to again. We had several guest speakers on the 3rd, some of whom I was highly impressed by. I spent this weekend working through the Bootstrap Challenge and believe I actually completed it. I guess we will see.</p>

				<h3>Marketing Initiative</h3>
				<p>I did not complete this initiative until November 3rd, but I began a conversation about what I have been doing to an acquaintance of mine when he asked how my day was. He was surprised to find out that I worked with code and quizzed me on a little of my knowledge. Turns out he hires freelance web developers to maintain his site for work, and has now added me to his list for projects that will come up in the future. Better than nothing I guess.</p>
				<h3 class="center">Team Building Game</h3>
				<p>During the team building game, our capstone group played "Forbidden Island." The game was a problem solving and strategy game. I noticed during play that Kevin and I were the "leaders" of the team, directing the game play. I realized that I am very direct and can come across as very assertive when making recommendations on game-play. Both Neena and Jack were very easy going and would pretty much take Kevin's or my advice, but it took a couple of explanations for me to convince Kevin to follow my lead. We did beat the game on the first go-around.</p>
