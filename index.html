			<br/>
			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<br/>
			<p>This week was mostly review on the prework. However, there were a few components that were new to me, such a the flow diagram. It was similar to the raptor program that Brian Jones demonstrated at the Tuesday evening TedTalk. Iam excited about the things to come and am eager to learn by jumping in and learning from the mistakes that I am inevitably going to make.</p>
			<br/>
			<h3>Week 2</h3>
			<p>This week was learning the basics of PHP and MySQL interaction. I found the material to be easy to comprehend as well as simple to perform. I became frustrated with the errors that came up in the PHPStorm software, so I worked ahead to connect the missing pieces required for the errors to be removed. I also was able to start working on the next steps due to being ahead. I also met with Daniel and Karen and discussed my progress in the class as well as what I planned for myself after completion.</p>
